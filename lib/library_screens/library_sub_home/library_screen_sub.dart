          "The story is interesting but so beyond reason I never really felt the suspense. While this story contains no aliens or supernatural events, it’s sci-fi in the vein of Jurassic Park: animals have become a threat to human existence, because of how humans have manipulated the natural world, and it’s up to one guy to convince the rest that humanity will go extinct unless they do something drastic. I’ve never read Pet Cemetary or Cujo or any of those classic animal-attack books, but I have read Congo and The Lost World, and I’ve gotta say that this is absolutely not my genre. I don’t know how I managed to finish them all in the first place, and I don’t really see myself every going back to this type of story.",
